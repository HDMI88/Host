---> 1. All Lua scripts are shared by users so please test them carefully before using.
---> 2. Tips: Test with 0.1 DOGE or 1 DOGE for about 1 day to find the settings, the strategy that works best for you. For example:
-- You have 0.1 LTC, test with 0.1 Doge about 1 day to find the most effective strategy, least risk. Then apply that setting, that strategy to 0.1 LTC.
-- You have 0.001 BTC, test with 0.001 Doge about 1 day to find the most effective strategy, least risk. Then apply that strategy setting to 0.001 BTC.
-- Similar to other coins.
-- PLEASE STOP PLAYING WHEN PROFIT CHART OR MARKET IS FLAT OR SIDEWAYS.
